                <p>In NATO countries the rank of captain
                is described by the code OF-2 and is
                one rank above an OF-1 ( lieutenant or
                first lieutenant) and one below an
                OF-3 ( major or commandant ). The
                rank of captain is generally
                considered to be the highest rank a
                soldier can achieve while remaining in
                the field.</p>>
                <p>In some militaries such as United
                States Army and Air Force and the
                British Army, captain is the entry-level
                rank for officer candidates possessing
                a professional degree, namely medical
                professionals (doctors, nurses,
                pharmacists, dentists) and lawyers.
                (In the United States Army, lawyers
                who are not already officers at
                captain rank or above enter as
                lieutenants during training, and are
                promoted to the rank of captain after
                completion of their training if they
                are in the active component, or after
                a certain amount of time, usually one
                year from their date of commission
                as a lieutenant, for the reserve
                components.)</p></font>
