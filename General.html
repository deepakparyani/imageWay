                    <p>The Chief of the Army Staff is the
                commander and usually the highest-
                ranking officer of the Indian Army .
                The position is abbreviated as COAS
                in Indian Army cables and
                communication, and usually held by
                a 4-star officer in the rank of
                General.</p>
                <p>The current COAS is General Dalbir
                Singh Suhag , who took office on 31
                July 2014 following retirement of
                General Bikram Singh .</p>
                <p>Lieutenant general, lieutenant-general
                and similar, (abbrev Lt Gen, LTG and
                similar), is a military rank (NATO code
                OF-8) used in many countries. The
                rank traces its origins to the Middle
                Ages where the title of lieutenant
                general was held by the second in
                command on the battlefield, who was
                normally subordinate to a captain
                general .</p></font>
