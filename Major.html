                    <p> Majors are typically assigned as
                specialized executive or operations
                officers for battallion-sized units of
                300 to 1,200 soldiers. In some
                militaries, notably France and Ireland,
                the rank of major is referred to as
                commandant , while in others it is
                known as captain-major . It is also
                used in some police forces and other
                paramilitary rank structures, such as
                the New York State Police , New Jersey
                State Police and several others. As a
                police rank, Major roughly
                corresponds to the UK rank of
                Superintendent .</p></font>
