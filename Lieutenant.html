                    <p>A lieutenant (abbreviated Lt. , LT. ,
                Lieut. and LEUT.) is a junior
                commissioned officer in many
                nations' armed forces, fire service , or
                law enforcement .</p>
                <p>The meaning of lieutenant differs in
                different military formations (see
                comparative military ranks ), but is
                often subdivided into senior (first
                lieutenant ) and junior ( second
                lieutenant ) ranks. In navies it is often
                equivalent to the army rank of
                captain; it may also indicate a
                particular post rather than a rank. The
                rank is also used in fire services,
                emergency medical services , security
                services and police forces.</p></font>
