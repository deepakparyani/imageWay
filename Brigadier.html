                <p>In many countries, especially those
                formerly part of the British Empire , a
                brigadier is either the highest field
                rank or most junior general
                appointment, nominally commanding
                a brigade. It ranks above colonel and
                below major general .</p>
                <p>The rank is used by the British Army ,
                the Royal Marines, the Australian
                Army , the Indian Army, the Sri Lankan
                Army , the New Zealand Army , the
                Pakistan Army and several others.
                Although it is not always considered a
                general officer rank, it is always
                considered equivalent to the brigadier
                general and brigade general rank of
                other countries. In NATO forces,
                brigadier is OF-6 on the rank scale.</p></font>
