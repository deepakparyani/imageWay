                    <p> Major general, major-general and
                similar are the names of a military
                rank used in many countries. It is
                derived from the older rank of
                sergeant major general . A major
                general is a high-ranking officer;
                normally the rank is subordinate to
                the rank of lieutenant general and
                senior to the ranks of brigadier and
                brigadier general. Where relevant, the
                rank has a NATO code of OF-7 , and is
                considered to be a two-star rank .[1] A
                major general in most armies
                commands a division, however in
                some countries he commands a
                brigade .</p>
                <p>In a number of countries, major
                general is the highest active rank
                used; for example, the Commander-
                in-Chief of the Estonian Defence
                Forces holds the rank of major
                general. [2] The rank of major general
                is equivalent to the navy rank of rear
                admiral, and in air forces with a
                separate rank structure, it is
                equivalent to air vice-marshal.
                Major general in the Indian Army is
                equivalent to rear admiral in the
                Indian Navy and air vice marshal in
                the Indian Air Force and is the lowest
                of the general officer ranks, ranking
                higher than a brigadier and lower
                than a lieutenant general.</p></font>
