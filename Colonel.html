                    <p>Colonel /ˈk ɜrn əl/ (abbreviated Col.,
                Col or COL) is a senior military officer
                rank below the general officer ranks.
                However in some small military forces
                such as those of Iceland or the
                Vatican colonel is the highest-rank. It
                is also used in some police forces and
                paramilitary organizations.</p>
                <p>Historically, in the seventeenth,
                eighteenth and nineteenth centuries,
                a colonel was typically in charge of a
                regiment in an army. Modern usage
                varies greatly.</p>
                <p>The rank of colonel is typically above
                the rank of lieutenant colonel . The
                rank above colonel is typically called
                brigadier , brigade general or
                brigadier general.
                Equivalent naval ranks may be called
                captain or ship-of-the-line captain . In
                the Commonwealth air force rank
                system, the equivalent rank is group
                captain.</p></font>
