                    <p>India has a field marshal rank, but it
                is mostly honorary. There are no Field
                Marshals in the army organizational
                structure at present and it has been
                conferred on only two officers in the
                past, namely the late Field Marshal
                Kodandera Madappa Cariappa and the
                late Field Marshal Manekshaw .</p>
                <p>A field marshal, unlike other officers,
                does not draw a pension. He gets the
                full pay of a general equal to the
                Chief of the Army Staff until his
                death. He wears full uniform on all
                official occasions and runs an office
                in army headquarters. He also has a
                dedicated secretariat of his own.</p></font>
